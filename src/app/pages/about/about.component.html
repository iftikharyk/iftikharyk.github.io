                <p class="subhead">
                    Hi, I’m Iftikhar. I'm a multi-talented human with over 4+ years of experiences in wide range of
                    design and development disciplines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also call me a product designer, experience designer, interaction, UI, UX or by any other
                    market defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 10 years of experiences
                    in wide range of design disciplines, manager, advisor, entrepreneur, front-end developer, music
                    enthusiast, traveler, photographer and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do.
                    Skills
                    can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and
                    do interesting things that matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more then willing to
                    follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with
                    a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead
                    I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic
                    endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles
                    with relative ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career. My
                    personality type is <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTJ.html" target="_blank"> ENTJ</a>. I
                    currently work
                    remotely with a selected freelance client base and are open for new opportunities.
                </p>
